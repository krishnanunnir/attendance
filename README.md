# attendance
e-attendance register is an idea put forward by a group of students from College of Engineering Trivandrum. An online portal for marking attendance was developed, which aims to replace the current system in which attendance is recorded in paper slips and manually entered into the database. 
The new portal provides an easy way for the professors to enter the attendance directly to the data base.
